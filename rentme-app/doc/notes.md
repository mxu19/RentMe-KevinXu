# Future Improvement

- Session managmenet should be completed using session id and proper session management libraries, i do not have enough time to investigate a good session management solution, therefore the login workflow is only crafted to demonstrate the business logic. Session management should consider workflows including, but not limited to: session creation, update, session window, revoke, disposal.
- componentnise the UI code into smaller more re-usable components
